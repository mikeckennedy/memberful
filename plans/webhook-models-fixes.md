# Memberful Webhook Models - Progress Summary

## Overview
We successfully reviewed and validated **ALL 16 webhook event models** to match Memberful's actual JSON structure from their webhook documentation. ðŸŽ‰

## Results Summary

| Model | Status | Changes Made |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `SubscriptionCreatedEvent` | âœ… **Fixed** | Complete restructure: removed incorrect `member`/`products`/`subscriptions` fields, added `subscription: Subscription` field |
| `MemberSignupEvent` | âœ… **Perfect** | Already correctly structured with `event` + `member` fields |
| `MemberUpdatedEvent` | âœ… **Fixed** | Removed incorrect `products`/`subscriptions` fields, added `changed: MemberChanges` field |
| `SubscriptionUpdatedEvent` | âœ… **Fixed** | Complete restructure: now uses `subscription: Subscription` + `changed: SubscriptionChanges` |
| `MemberDeletedEvent` | âœ… **Fixed** | Removed unnecessary `products`/`subscriptions` fields, kept `member: DeletedMember` |
| `SubscriptionRenewedEvent` | âœ… **Fixed** | Complete restructure: now uses `subscription: Subscription` + `order: Order` |
| `SubscriptionActivatedEvent` | âœ… **Fixed** | Complete restructure: removed incorrect fields, added `subscription: Subscription` |
| `OrderCompletedEvent` | âœ… **Perfect** | Already correctly structured with `event` + `order` fields |
| `OrderSuspendedEvent` | âœ… **Perfect** | Already correctly structured with `event` + `order` fields |
| `SubscriptionPlanCreatedEvent` | âœ… **Perfect** | Already correctly structured with `event` + `subscription` (plan data) |
| `SubscriptionPlanUpdatedEvent` | âœ… **Perfect** | Already correctly structured with `event` + `subscription` (plan data) |
| `SubscriptionPlanDeletedEvent` | âœ… **Perfect** | Already correctly structured with `event` + `subscription` (plan data) |

**Final Count**: 6 models fixed, 6 models already perfect

## Key Models Created/Enhanced

### New Models Created:
- **`Subscription`** - Webhook-specific subscription data with nested `Member` and `SubscriptionPlan`
- **`MemberChanges`** - Tracks field changes in member updates with `[old_value, new_value]` arrays

### Enhanced Existing Models:
- **`Order`** - Made flexible for webhook variations:
  - `number: Optional[str]` (not always present)
  - `created_at: Union[int, str]` (handles both Unix timestamps and ISO strings)
  - `member: Optional[Member]` (for simple vs complex order contexts)
  
- **`SubscriptionPlan`** - Added `price_cents` field for webhook compatibility
- **`SubscriptionChanges`** - Already existed and worked correctly

### Import Updates:
- Added `Union` to typing imports for flexible type handling

## Common Issues Fixed

### The Pattern:
Most broken models had the **same structural problem**: they used separate `member`, `products`, `subscriptions` fields instead of the actual webhook structure.

### Before (Broken):
```python
class SomeSubscriptionEvent(WebhookBaseModel):
    event: str
    member: Optional[Member] = None
    products: list[Product] = Field(default_factory=list)  
    subscriptions: list[MemberSubscription] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
class SomeSubscriptionEvent(WebhookBaseModel):
    event: str
    subscription: Subscription  # Contains nested member and plan data
```
